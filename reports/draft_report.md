1) In your project repository on GitHub, you should already have directories named "code" and "reports". Please confirm that they exist and have the right (case-sensitive) names.

2) Compose a document in the "reports" directory called "draft_report.md", which should be a reasonably formatted Markdown document describing your project and results (see below for details).

3) Submit a link directly to this document (not to the top level of your repository).
The content of the draft report should be similar to the proposal but :
1) It should be updated based on your progress (so it should be primarily in the present and past tense), and
2) It should be written for an external audience, not addressed to the instructor.
It should contain the following elements (but it should not include a list of these prompts):

1) A meaningful title (not "Draft Report"), and the full names of the authors.

2) An abstract that identifies the topics you are investigating and the tools you are using.

3) An annotated bibliography of papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.

4) A description of the experiment from these papers that you are replicating and the extensions or variations of those experiments you are working on.

5) Results from the replication and possibly preliminary results from the extension. Or if you don't have results, sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.

6) Interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by the model resembles pink noise."

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.

8) Outline next steps.  For each team member, what do you plan to work on immediately?  For the team, what do you think you can get done in the next week?  Consider using GitHub Projects to make a kanban board to track tasks.
