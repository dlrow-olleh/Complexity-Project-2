**Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?**

My understanding is that the team is replicating an experiment that studies the and behaviour of collectively choosing the best site for habitation even when only one and has visited that site. The paper has identified a collection of factors that may influence these decisions, one of which is the quality of the site being tested. HK and Maal are using this model to test the identified factors to see how much influence they hold over the ant behaviours. Their explanation is mostly clear, however, I think it would benefit from including a brief explanation of "graded commitment" and explicitly identifying at least some of the parameters they are exploring. I am also slightly confused about what constitutes a "big step" vs a "small step". I am uncertain about the question they are trying to answer. I interpreted that they may be trying to identify the driving parameters of the decision-making process however this is not reflected in their writing. So far, I understand that they are trying to replicate this model as a visual demonstration of ant migrating behaviours.

**Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?**

From my understanding, the pair are planning on implementing the replicated model in one go altogether and then implementing the extensions incrementally. The methodology for their model seems to make sense overall, however, I am having some trouble understanding the details of it. Specifically, I am curious about what actions constitute the assessment phase, what parameters factor into the decision making and how this decision is made, what element the decision is optimising for. I also don't understand the significance of the "canvassing" and "committed" steps in the process and what information these parts of the model provide. I would also like to see what decisions they have made in terms of implementing this model.

**Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?**

With the provided caption, it is easy to get an understanding of what the result is showing: the change in the population of each anthill upon discovery of a new one. The visualisation is effective for what it is trying to show and fits in with the model in showing how each anthill changes over time. I am uncertain about the design of their planned results. From my understanding, it seems that they want to present an animated depiction of their agents (belong to different anthills) moving around to a new burrow, however, I am uncertain about how they will depict this and how to access the information from this style of a graph.

**Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?**

Currently, the draft has not presented an interpretation of the results.

**Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency? Is it quantitative or qualitative?**

Currently, the writers have not discussed whether their results match those of the original paper.

**Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?**

It is hard to say whether the extension will answer their intended question as I am uncertain about what that question is. Their plan for extension is to experiment with the inclusion and exclusion of various parameters, and also to study the behaviour of the same ants when presented with obstacles. I believe that the former extension presents an interesting space of exploration of and behaviour such as "what could happen if ants were more or less x". I am unable to identify a feasible behavioural parameter x as the included parameters were included in the problem statement. 

**Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?**

The replication seems like it is still incomplete. They have defined their next steps in detail, but there seems to be more to do before they are done with this step. In addition, they have outlined multiple avenues they wish to pursue as an extension, but whether they have chosen one to pursue or defined what these may entail in higher detail is unclear.

**Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?**

In general, the report is concise and accurate. It could use more clarity in the explanation and the definition of the problem space, and the discussion of the results' interpretation. The language is scoped well for a general audience and easy to understand-- it suits the report. However, the addition of some similarly accessible technical details would benefit it. It does not violate the style guide in any major way. There is one instance of the quantifier 'very', and the results graph could use more descriptive labels for the axes and a title.

**Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?**

The report is in the correct directory with the correct filename. Its formatting is appropriate with the full presentation of the authors' names. The title, I believe, could be modified to better reflect the question they are asking. The bibliography is in an appropriate style.
