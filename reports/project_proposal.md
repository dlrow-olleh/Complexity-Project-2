# Sugarscape model in the midst of an epidemic
###### by Ally Bell and Mahima Beltur

## Abstract
Sugarscape is a model that, in a simple way, represents reward-seeking and resource accumulating behaviours in societies. In this project we will explore how the behaviours of our agents are modified with the introduction of an epidemic disease begins to affect the population. The disease will spread to closeby agents and greatly increase the probability of the agent dying, unless they receive significant "aid" by surrounding agents. The amount of aid is measured by the number of neighboring agents. We plan on modelling the contagious disease in a similar manner to the forest fire model. We will explore how different rates of contagion will influence the agents of different ranges of vision when they are programed to move away from disease, but closer to a bigger source of sugar. It will be interesting to note which desire wins out more: life or wealth?

3) An annotated bibliography of one or more papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.
## Experiment and Results
4) Present an experiment from these papers that you plan to replicate and any extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.
5) Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.
6) Explain how you will interpret the results. How will you know if results from your replicated experiment are consistent with the original. Is there a particular measurement or figure you can compare?
## Areas of Concern
7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.
