# Sugarscape model in the midst of an epidemic
###### by Ally Bell and Mahima Beltur

## Abstract
Sugarscape is a model that, in a simple way, represents reward-seeking and resource accumulating behaviours in societies. In this project we will explore how the behaviours of our agents are modified with the introduction of an epidemic disease begins to affect the population. The disease will spread to closeby agents and greatly increase the probability of the agent dying, unless they receive significant "aid" by surrounding agents. The amount of aid is measured by the number of neighboring agents. We plan on modelling the contagious disease in a similar manner to the forest fire model. We will explore how different rates of contagion will influence the agents of different ranges of vision when they are programed to move away from disease, but closer to a bigger source of sugar. It will be interesting to note which desire wins out more: life or wealth?

#### An Agent-Based Model of Epidemic Spread Using Human Mobility and Social Network Information

This paper uses an agent based approach to evaluate the effects that govornment restrictions on the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Mexico. To characterize agent's behavior, patterns of interactions and individual movement are collected from call records. This allows for accurate modeling of virus spreading, and allows an understanding of the effects of govornment restricti, ons that were put into place. The simulation produced shows that govornment mandates reduced by 10% the peak number of cases at a time, and postponed the peak - flattening the curve.

3) An annotated bibliography of one or more papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.
## Experiment and Results

4) Present an experiment from these papers that you plan to replicate and any extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.
5) Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.
6) Explain how you will interpret the results. How will you know if results from your replicated experiment are consistent with the original. Is there a particular measurement or figure you can compare?
## Areas of Concern

Notes from class:
- Need to be cognizant of how we're bringing two types of models together which answer very different questions: sugarscape is about finding resources where an epidemic disease model is about transmission
- violet heart math videos, early on in covid how things should be opened or not
- model could spontaniously show two different strategies
- vision and metabolism in sugar scape, so as the system evoled we got more vision less metabolism. This answer feels somewhat obvious, whereas there is not an obvious anwer with the model we are doing
- we could have a parameter that was continuous and resprestned some strategry - disease, inclination to wander, 
- it would be interesting to end up with a bimodal distribution

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.
## Next Steps
### Mahima
I will spend some time studying the implementation of epidemic models and planning out ways that we might be able to apply these concepts to the sugarscape model. I will also brainstorm some metrics we can focus on measuring after we have a working model.

### Ally
I'm going to work on writing a first implementation of this model and get it to Mahima 11/21.
