##### Question: What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating? What question does it answer? How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is recreating an experiment that models ant's movement as a group while selecting a new nesting site. This seems like a really interesting model, although I'm not sure what additional question the paper is addressing. Their explanation of the model and behavior makes a lot of sense, and felt very grounded in real world understanding.

##### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology? Does it make sense for the question? Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology makes sense, although I'm not sure what question is being approached. The team seems like they're doing a good job considering the model and it's structure, although this is of course, as they acknowledged, a hard system.

##### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)? If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective? Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The results are clearly laid out in a well presented graph, showing the ants in different locations over time. I think the label of "Home" is rather confusing, as I wasn't clear that this meant their future home and not their current nest. The written out results showing ant movement is really helpful, and presented really well.

##### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question? Does the argument hold water?

Not yet, but it seems like they're in a direction to be able to do this once they have results from their model and decide on a question.

##### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper? If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency? Is it quantitative or qualitative?

I'm not super clear about if the team has gotten results that match the original paper, although it seems like this is a work in progress. The graph demonstrating ant population in different places seems to be able to make this comparison quantitatively.

##### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly? Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

Right now, the team doesn't know what question they're trying to answer. Some of their ideas for this extension seem interesting, but have not yet been decided upon or modeled.

##### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

The team seems to have a good idea of what they are doing, but they have not yet figured out their extension or fully recreated the original paper.

##### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language? Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report? Does it violate any of the recommendations in [my style guide](https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/style-guide)?

The report does a good job of using clear language, and describing the behavior they're expecting to observe. Not everything is fully clear at the moment, but that makes sense with where they are at in the modeling process. The explanations are grounded in ways that make sense and are clear to an audience coming in without an understanding of this model.

##### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name? Is it formatted professionally in Markdown? Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors? Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Looks good! Everything is there, perhaps the title should include something about selecting a new nesting site, as it seems like the model is about the steps before deicing emigration as well.
