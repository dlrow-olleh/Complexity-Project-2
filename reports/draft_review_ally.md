##### Question: What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating? What question does it answer? How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is recreating an experiment that models ant's movement as a group while selecting a new nesting site. This seems like a really interesting model, although I'm not sure what additional question the paper is addressing. Their explanation of the model and behavior makes a lot of sense, and felt very grounded in real world understanding.

##### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology? Does it make sense for the question? Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology makes sense, although I'm not sure what question is being approached. The team seems like they're doing a good job considering the model and it's structure, although this is of course, as they acknowledged, a hard system.

##### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)? If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective? Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The results are clearly laid out in a well presented graph, showing the ants in different locations over time. I think the label of "Home" is rather confusing, as I wasn't clear that this meant their future home and not their current nest. The written out results showing ant movement is really helpful, and presented really well.

##### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question? Does the argument hold water?



Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper? If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency? Is it quantitative or qualitative?

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly? Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language? Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report? Does it violate any of the recommendations in [my style guide (Links to an external site.)](https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/style-guide)?

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name? Is it formatted professionally in Markdown? Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors? Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
